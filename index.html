<h2>What is Nerd Central?</h2>
<p>Nerd Central is the student show about nerd news on KNWT Channel 8. Throughout the 26-minute show,
  we cover recent news, student segments, and a new competitive game segment that changes every semester.</p>
<p>Student segments can cover anything from weird shark movies to the stories behind your favorite songs.
  This season we have Tasting TV, Trashflix, Back to the 80's, Halloween Forever, Musical Mania, and In the Booth.</p>
<p>For our competition segment, this season our veteran crew members are competing for the right to host season 10
  next semester. With an anime theme surrounding the competition, the Anime Olympics are well underway!

<h2>A Brief History</h2>
<p>Nerd Central began in 2017 as a pack-based news show on KNWT Channel 8. Since
  then, Nerd Central has grown into something more than just a news show. It has
  become a place where people can share their opinions without judgement and simply
  have fun.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2020, The Nerd Games were born. The Nerd Games are a series of competitions that put crew
   members against one another to compete for some form of bragging rights. Each season, a central theme surrounds
   The Nerd Games to create themed games each week.</p>
   <p>It started with the Incredibles Challenge, where each game was themed after a member of the Incredibles
  family from Disney. This challenge was a result of Producer Cody and Host Krysta who wer feuding about who loved the
  show more. In the end, the two were able to settle that both of them loved the show equally.</p>
  <p>Next was the Justice Leauge Games, which pitted crew members Emma and Kyle against one another. The winning
  team captain would become the next producer of Nerd Central. In the end, Kyle reigned victorious, but has
  mysteriously disappeared since claiming victory.</p>
  <p>Now, crew member Paige has stepped in to fill the position as producer, but Emma has set her sights on a
    new role she'd like to fill. This season it's Emma against Krysta for the right to become the host for next season.
    Who will come out on top? Tune in to Channel 8 to find out.</p>
